# unsplashBackground
Pick a random image from unsplash.com and make it the windows background

You'll need to create a python file called "AccessKey.py" and paste in your unsplash.com access key. Just sign up for a developer account on unsplash.com to get one.

The bundled .exe can be run with the windows "Task Scheduler". Create a new task, pick your trigger, and tell it to execute background.exe.
